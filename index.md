##  Break
The coffee break over the four days will always be from 10:30AM to 11:00AM.

## Syllabus

* We will go through the following content in 5 days. We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises.

* NOTE 1: for each colab file below, you should make a copy in your own google drive to edit & run.

* NOTE 2: some questions are “optional”—you are suggested but not required to do.
